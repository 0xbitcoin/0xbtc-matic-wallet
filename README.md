# 0xBTC Matic Wallet

### Still in active development!  Please contribute with pull requests.

A web3 wallet for 0xBTC that works with the Matic and Ethereum networks.

This dapp is deployed at Https://wallet.0xbtc.io



## Project setup

```
npm install
npm run serve
```


## Development Checklist

* Need to complete metamask login flow using the /login page
* Need to add a 'switcher' toggle button to switch views between Ethereum and Matic mainnets (see https://wallet.matic.network for an example)
* Need to render balances of Ether, 0xBTC, and Matic assets on both network views (6 total assets)
* Need to create a form that will facilitate moving assets between the two networks (see https://github.com/BlockTimeWorld/matic-pos-bridge for sample code)
